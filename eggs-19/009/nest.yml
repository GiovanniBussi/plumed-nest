  The zip files contains the trajectories discussed in the paper as well as
  a couple of plumed input files that were used for analysis. In order to run
  the metadynamics simulations described in the paper one should fix the metadynamics
  parameters (height and pace). In addition, histograms were computed using a syntax
  that changed in PLUMED 2.4. To use them with a more recent PLUMED they should be updated.
