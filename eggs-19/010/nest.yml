  this is a metadynamic metainference calculation using residual dipolar coupling to infere
  the interdomain dynamics of a two domain proteins. There are two proteins (wt and a mutant).
  the protoctol is in two step, first with plumed-orient.dat ones generate a good starting condition
  for the replicas such as that the agreement with RDCs is ok, then the proper sampling begins.
plumed_mpi: True
