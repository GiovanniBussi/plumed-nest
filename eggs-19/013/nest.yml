  The zip file contains the code used to fit dihedral corrections.
  It also contains a PLUMED input file that can be used to apply
  corrections for a AAAA tetranucleotide. In order to generate
  corrections for RNA molecules with different sequences, one should
  download the script and modify it accordingly. The paper describing this work
  is currently submitted.
