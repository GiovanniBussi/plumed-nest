  Neural networks were created by [ancolvar](https://github.com/spiwokv/anncolvar) and used to approximate Isomap CVs in 5 ns metadynamics of cyclooctane derivative and to approximate molecular surface area in 0.5 ns metadynamics, 1 ns parallel tempering and 1 ns parallel tempering metadynamics of Trp-cage folding with molecular surface area and alpha-RMSD CVs.
