When you see an input including the badge
[![with LOAD](https://img.shields.io/badge/with-LOAD-yellow.svg)](),
you should consider that this input file uses the `LOAD` action, which in turn
compiles on the fly some code that is provided along with the input file.
This means that this input file uses some source code that is not included in the
official PLUMED distribution and might be thus less tested.
