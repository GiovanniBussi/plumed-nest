* __What is PLUMED-NEST?__

  PLUMED-NEST is the public repository of the PLUMED consortium. It provides all the data
  needed to reproduce the results of a PLUMED-enhanced molecular dynamics simulation (or analysis)
  contained in a published paper. 

* __What is the PLUMED consortium?__

  The PLUMED consortium is an open community composed of current and past developers, contributors, 
  and all those researchers whose work builds in part on PLUMED and at the same time drives 
  the development and dissemination of PLUMED.
  The mission of the consortium is to transform the way researchers communicate the 
  protocols that are used in their MD simulations, in order to maximize the impact of 
  new research and promote the highest possible standards of scientific reproducibility. 

  More information about the PLUMED consortium can be found here:

  [citation to the paper]

  and the list of current members and coordinators can be found [here](Members.md). 

* __How to contribute to PLUMED-NEST__

  Everybody can contribute to PLUMED-NEST. It is sufficient to provide
  a link to an archive containing all the data needed to reproduce a 
  PLUMED-enhanced simulation (or analysis) along with some additional information.
  More detailed instructions and the form to upload a contribution can be found here.
