   The input files were used to perform a metadynamics simulation in which a nanoparticle was forced to adsorb and desorb from a membrane surface. 
   The free energy as a function of the distance between the nanoparticle and the surface was computed. As discussed in the attached article 
   molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS 5 and the non-polarizable MARTINI model.
