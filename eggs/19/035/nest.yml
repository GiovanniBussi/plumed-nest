  The contributed input files define umbrella sampling simulations on the relative distance and orientation of two mu-opioid receptor dimers. The proteins and explicit membrane are described using the Martini coarse-grained model. Gromacs (5.1.3) and PLUMED (2.2.3) input files and Martini 2.0 topologies are provided.
