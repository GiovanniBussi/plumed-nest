  Path collective variables (PCV) defined using inter-molecular contact maps between the side-chain center of masses of residues are used to describe the transition between the active and inactive crystal structures of the mu-opioid receptor bound to morphine. PLUMED (2.2.3) and Gromacs (5.1.4) input topologies and initial coordinates are provided.
